# Neptuniaâ„¢ Virtual Stars Camera Tools

Requires the latest Cheat Engine release. Compatible with the April 6th update, which is the latest Steam version as of the day this is being written.

This is a pre-release, fixes to current problems and more features will be added later on.

1. Unzip the "NepVS_CameraTools.CT" somewhere.
2. Run the game and go to the main hub.
3. Minimize the game and run Cheat Engine.
4. Load the cheat table you unzipped earlier.
5. Enable the "Structures (Activate First!)" address in the address list.
6. Minimize Cheat Engine and go back to the game.

Keybinds are in the image bundled with this ZIP file, but feel free to change the currents hotkeys.

If disabling the HUD doesn't work, open and close the teleport menu (R on the keyboard / SELECT (Playstation) / View Button(Xbox)) while in the hub.

Current problems:

 - Freezing the world will also freeze some rendering elements related to characters and enemies (fresnel and some parts of the rim-lighting), which makes things look off if you moved the camera too much in relation to the position at the moment you froze everything. I'll be looking further into this when I have more time.

- The depth of field effect breaks when flying the camera around, so I disabled it whenever the free camera is engaged. This has a lower priority than the aforementioned issue but is still a problem nonetheless.

- Pausing the world also seems to mess with the game's temporal anti-aliasing solution. It is hard for me to pinpoint what exactly is happening but there is no denying that the game gets more aliased when frozen.

- Turning this into something easier to use than a cheat table would be nice, but getting this working properly is the top priority.
